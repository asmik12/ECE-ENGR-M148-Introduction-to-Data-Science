Cancellations can be detrimental to the business, as it may become challenging to rebook a room on short notice.

significantly larger number of samples of negative (0) observations than positive (1) observations. This means that the dataset has more examples of people who did not cancel than people who cancelled. Thus the final model might be more inclined to predict 0 (unlikely to cancel) rather than 1 (likely to cancel). Balanced datasets are important to ensure that classifiers train adequately and don't overfit, and this particular dataset might be enriched by obtaining more samples of people who did cancel.
